# Hooks

This directory contains custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic and state management.

## useAuth

The [useAuth.js](file:///d:/claario/frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.js) hook provides authentication state management:

- Tracks the current user
- Handles loading states during authentication checks
- Listens for authentication state changes
- Provides a clean interface for components to access auth status

This hook simplifies authentication logic across components and ensures consistent user state throughout the application.
